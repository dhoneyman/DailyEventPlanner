# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

This is a work day scheduler app! An individual can enter their tasks for the day, click save and have them saved to the local storage. The text areas will also change colors dependent on the time of day. Text fields are red if the hour has passed, grey if its within the current hour and green if the hour has yet to come. The current date is also displayed at the top of the page.
